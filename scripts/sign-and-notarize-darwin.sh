# Sign and notarize a single darwin binary as a GoReleaser post-build hook.
#
# Runs inside the build phase, before any artifact is uploaded, so a signing or
# notarization failure aborts the release instead of leaving signed-but-
# unnotarized archives on a published GitHub Release and in the Homebrew tap.
#
# Usage: sign-and-notarize-darwin.sh <goos> <binary-path> [is-snapshot]
#
# is-snapshot is GoReleaser's {{ .IsSnapshot }}. A snapshot build is never
# published, and `make release-snapshot` has no Apple credentials, so signing is
# skipped there. Release runs pass "false" and must sign.
